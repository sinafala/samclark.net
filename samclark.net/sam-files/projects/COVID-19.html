<h4>Background</h4>

<p>
  During 2020, a team of researchers from The Ohio State University conducted three projects to better understand the extent and effects of the COVID-19 epidemic in Ohio.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>A representative, state-wide prevalence study of adults to characterize ever- and currently-infected with the coronavirus,</li>
  <li>A state- and county-level excess deaths study to estimate the total mortality burden associated with the epidemic in Ohio, and</li>
  <li>A representative, weekly telephone survey to characterize the prevalence and trend in COVID-19 symptoms and protective behaviors.</li>
</ol>

<h4>COVID-19 Prevalence Study</h4>

<p>
  The prevalence study used a sample survey that was conducted in July, 2020. Both ever-infected and currently-infected prevalence rates were low at that time. A publication describing the results in detail is under review now.
</p>

<p>
  Existing statistical methods for the analysis of survey data were inadequate for the unusual data produced by the prevalence survey. Our team developed a new statistical approach to solve those challenges. A publication describing the new methods and their application to the survey data in detail is under review now and also available as an arXiv preprint,

</ul>

<p>
  I was invited to write a commentary for PNAS based on experience with the prevalence study, and I did that with Abigail Norris Turner who led the overall study. We highlight the need to improve response rates and to prepare a robust measurement capability to be ready for the next pandemic.

</ul>

<h4>Excess Deaths Study</h4>

<p>
  The excess deaths study is ongoing. For the state, results closely match those of the CDC, see <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/excess_deaths.htm" target="_blank">CDC excess deaths report and data</a>. County-level results reveal heterogeneity in both levels and timing of patterns of excess deaths. 
</p>

<h4> Weekly Telephone Survey</h4>

<p>
  Data from the weekly telephone survey were not as useful as we had hoped. 
</p>

<h4>COVID-19 Routine Mortality Surveillance</h4>

<p>
  In addition to the work in Ohio, I work closely with the NGO Vital Strategies on a project to develop a COVID-19 routine mortality surveillance (CRMS) tool based on the verbal autopsy method. This work is in progress with partners in Colombia and Brazil.
