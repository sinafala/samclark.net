      <h1>Background</h1>

      <p>
        During 2020, a team of researchers from The Ohio State University conducted three projects to better understand the extent and effects of the COVID-19 epidemic in Ohio.
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          A representative, state-wide prevalence study of adults to characterize ever- and currently-infected with the coronavirus,
        </li>
        <li>
          A state- and county-level excess deaths study to estimate the total mortality burden associated with the epidemic in Ohio, and
        </li>
        <li>
          A representative, weekly telephone survey to characterize the prevalence and trend in COVID-19 symptoms and protective behaviors.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h1>COVID-19 Prevalence Study</h1>

      <p>
        The prevalence study used a sample survey that was conducted in July, 2020. Both ever-infected and currently-infected prevalence rates were low at that time. A publication describing the results appears in <em>Annals of Epidemiology</em>.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="http://doi.org/10.1016/j.annepidem.2021.11.009" target="_blank">Prevalence of Current and Past COVID-19 in Ohio Adults</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Existing statistical methods for the analysis of survey data were inadequate for the unusual data produced by the prevalence survey. Our team developed a new statistical approach to solve those challenges. A description of the new methods and their application to the survey data is published in PNAS, and the R code used in the analysis is available on Github,
      </p>

        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        I was invited to write a commentary for PNAS based on experience with the prevalence study, and I did that with Abigail Norris Turner who led the overall study. We highlight the need to improve response rates and to prepare a robust measurement capability to be ready for the next pandemic.

        </li>
      </ul>

      <h1>Excess Deaths Study</h1>

      <p>
        The excess deaths study is ongoing. For the state, results closely match those of the CDC, see <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/excess_deaths.htm" target="_blank">CDC excess deaths report and data</a>. County-level results reveal heterogeneity in both levels and timing of patterns of excess deaths. 
      </p>

      <h1> Weekly Telephone Survey</h1>

      <p>
        Data from the weekly telephone survey were not as useful as we had hoped. 
      </p>

      <h1>COVID-19 Routine Mortality Surveillance</h1>

      <p>
        In addition to the work in Ohio, I work closely with the NGO <a href="https://www.vitalstrategies.org/programs/civil-registration-and-vital-statistics/" target="_blank">Vital Strategies</a> on a project to develop a COVID-19 routine mortality surveillance (CRMS) tool based on the verbal autopsy method. This work is in progress with partners in Colombia and Brazil.
