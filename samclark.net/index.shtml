  I am a demographer, epidemiologist, and data scientist who develops new methods and does research in demography and epidemiology. <a href="http://clarissasurekclark.name" target="_blank">Clarissa Surek-Clark</a> and I collaborate in life and various professional endeavors. 
</p><p>
  I work as a <a href="https://sociology.osu.edu/people/clark.2962" target="_blank">professor</a> in the <a href="https://sociology.osu.edu" target="_blank">Department of Sociology</a> at <a href="https://www.osu.edu" target="_blank">The Ohio State University</a> (OSU), and I am a faculty affiliate of the <a href="https://ipr.osu.edu" target="_blank">Institute for Population Research</a> and the <a href="https://tdai.osu.edu" target="_blank">Translational Data Analytics Institute</a>, both at OSU. I am affiliated with the <a href="https://stat.uw.edu/" target="_blank">Department of Statistics</a> at the University of Washington and the <a href="https://www.wits.ac.za/publichealth/" target="_blank">School of Public Health</a> at the University of the Witwatersrand. 
</p><p>
  During 2020 I worked on a survey to estimate the prevalence of the coronavirus and an excess deaths study to characterize the total burden of mortality associated with the COVID-19 epidemic. Both projects are in the state of Ohio, USA and were conducted by large teams at The Ohio State University in close coordination with the Ohio State Department of Health.
</p><p>
  On an ongoing basis I work to improve: 1) verbal autopsy as a tool to measure the burden of disease, 2) mathematical models of human mortality, 3) indirect estimates of child mortality, and 4) small-area estimates of mortality. I also coordinate a small team developing software to implement new methods - mostly for verbal autopsy and mathematical models of human mortality.
</p><p>
  I lead the <a href="http://openva.net" target="_blank">openVA Team</a> that works to improve verbal autopsy.
