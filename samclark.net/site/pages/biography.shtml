  My personal biography in space and time is complex and not easy to explain in a minute or two.  Following is a very brief summary that only mentions the main space-time and professional aspects.
</p><p>
  I was born and mostly lived in East Africa until about age sixteen. I went to high school in Pendleton Oregon and did undergraduate degrees at Caltech in Pasadena. I did one year in a neuroscience PhD program at Stanford in Palo Alto before switching to demography and doing a PhD in demography at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. During the PhD I lived in Monze, Zambia for about one year. Following the PhD I was a postdoc at the University of Colorado at Boulder for about five years. During that time I lived in Durban, South Africa and mainly worked with the Agincourt health and demographic surveillance system site. After the postdoc I moved to the University of Washington in Seattle as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Sociology.  After obtaining tenure there and spending a few years as Associate Professor, I moved to The Ohio State University in Columbus as a Full Professor in the Department of Sociology.
